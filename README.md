- 👋 Hi, I’m @BrunnRita
- 👀 I’m interested in design, programming in Python, teaching, and hiking in the mountains.
- 💞️ I want to create my own convenient service for tutors
- 📫 You can contact me by telegram (@brunnrita) or by mail (brunnerita@gmail.com)
- ⚡ Fun fact: As a child, I couldn’t answer the question “what do you want to be when you grow up?”, so I decided not to grow (yes, my height is 156 cm).
